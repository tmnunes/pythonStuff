Bugs/Patches Welcome: http://bugs.launchpad.net/gasp-code/+filebug

There is an excellent coursebook <http://openbookproject.net/pybiblio/gasp/>
which goes over learning to use GASP in your own applications, which is
designed to supplement (but can be used apart from)
<http://openbookproject.net/thinkCSpy/>, a full-fledged introduction to
the Python programming language.

DEPENDENCIES
======
GASP requires the following to function:
 * python-cairo
 * python-gobject
 * python-gtk2
 * python-multiprocessing (only on python 2.5)

GASP is tested with Python 2.5 and Python 2.6. Python 3.0 is unsupported at
this time.
